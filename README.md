# ReZygisk's Treat Wheel

World's most advanced and simplest general purpose root module.

## Features

- C99
- Traceless
- Low complexity

## Requirements

- Magisk Official, KernelSU Official (or API compliant), or APatch
- ReZygisk 508 or higher
- Android 7.1 or higher

> [!WARNING]
> Absolutely NO support will be given if requirements are NOT met.

## Usage

The only feature of Treat Wheel that requires setup is RVU (ReVanced Umount). ReVanced modules MUST include a `tw_config` file in their module folder with the following content:

```properties
module_type=revanced
allow_umount=true
```

Which will allow Treat Wheel to enumerate the amount of ReVanced modules -- hence amount of mounts it should find -- and umount them.
